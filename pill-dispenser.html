            <p id="background-content"> For junior design, I along with a team of 9 were tasked with filling 12 bottles with 30 pills each. We engineered a pill dispenser that, while a small component of the overall project, is a compelling machine on its own.</p>

            <p>(Talk about first double gate hand operated pill dispenser)</p>
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="first-pill-dispenser.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            
            <p>The concept was then reiterated to use a gear in order to shuttle the pills down a hole. A limit switch was installed to count how many times the gear has moved via the physical pressing of the limit switch with the gear tooth. It has code to sync up with the rotary table and to stop dispensing once the limit switch detects thirty gear clicks which indicates all thirty pills dispensed.</p>

                <img src="limit-switch-pill-dispenser.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;">

            </div>
            <p class="media-caption">The actual circuitry</p>

            <p>Although, the limit switch had a 100% success rate at dispensing 30 pills, a problem arose where when the pill dispenser is near empty, not every gear tooth will hold a pill, but it still gets counted any way, affecting how many pills go into the last few bottles. So the limit switch was replaced to a break beam sensor, using the physical breaking of a beam to count how many pills were dispensed.</p>
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="first-pill-dispenser.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;">

              <p class="media-caption">Wiring diagram of the pill dispenser.</p>
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="jr-design-google-doc.JPG" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            
            <p>By itself, the pill dispenser was able to accurately dispense 30 pills even when not all of the gear teeth were full, but unfortunately, it wasn't well synced with the rotary table, leading to premature dispensing when there wasn't a bottle underneath.</p>
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="replica-circuit.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>

            <p>So fast forward 2 years, I have synced the pill dispenser to start dispensing after a certain amount of rotary table rotations and then it will start dispensing.</p>
