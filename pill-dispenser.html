            <h2>Iteration</h2>
            
            <p>Before getting to motors and sensors, a rough prototype was generated where there would be 2 gates to dispense and let in 30 pills all operated by hand.</p>
            <div class="media-container">

            </div>
            
            <p> We ran into an issue where the pills would get jammed in the funnel and realizing that a 2 gate system would require more than 1 motor, making the pill dispenser complicated and cluttered. The concept was then reiterated to use a gear in order to clear any jams and shuttle the pills down a hole. A limit switch was installed to count how many times the gear has moved via the physical pressing of the limit switch with the gear tooth. It has code to sync up with the rotary table and to stop dispensing once the limit switch counts thirty gear clicks, indicating all thirty pills dispensed.</p>

            <p class="media-caption">Initial prototype had motor stalling and needed a push to get the momentum going. The torque was later increased.</p>

            <p>Although, the limit switch had a 100% success rate at dispensing 30 pills with a full container, a problem arose where when the pill dispenser is near empty, not every gear tooth will hold a pill, but it still gets counted any way, affecting how many pills go into the last few bottles. So the limit switch was replaced to a break beam sensor, using the physical breaking of a beam to count how many pills were dispensed.</p>
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src="jr-design-images/break-beam-test.gif" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 8px;">

            </div>

            <p>By itself, the pill dispenser was able to accurately dispense 30 pills even when not all of the gear teeth were full, but unfortunately, it wasn't well synced with the rotary table, leading to premature dispensing when there wasn't a bottle underneath. With a time crunch at the time, there wasn't enough time to address the issue before the junior design presentation. So fast forward 2 years, I have synced the pill dispenser to start dispensing after a certain amount of rotary table rotations as well as continuing the next rotary table rotation after 30 pills were dispensed.</p>
